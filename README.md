I'm @DasoTD, an enterprise security-Software Engineer and a currently transitioned into cloud engineering. I've got few years of experience working as backend engineer in the banking industry(Fintech) with a little touch of blockchain (remember the word little) and government insitutions. A master in Applied Cybersecurity in XX, and few months of experience as a digital forensic trainee.
I love linux, I still feel like I don't know alot but I love the known little, I extensively write GO, Javascript and Typescript. 
I studied cloud engineering at AltSchool Africa <a href="https://altschoolafrica.com/schools/engineering" rel="nofollow">School of Software Engineering</a>  and my scope of learning revolves around Linux, AWS.
I love playing around with Wireshark, BurpSuite and other web | network testing tools(I love Ethical Hacking).
